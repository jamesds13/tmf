## Winning on your Birthday - Farmers Session

Well, well, well. The mighty Farmer made it around the sun again. As is the custom, he got to run the session and buy the breakfast. If the session he planned and his performance in it are anything to go by he will no doubt circle the sun many more times. 

On a picture perfect morning at 'Curly' beach a sand session that *almost* made Paddy spew was a fitting. With penalties for dropping the ball as the group trotted north on the beach there was a sense of doom. Everyone knows how s#*t the sand dunes can be. The group was deliberately lethargic in its movement north on the sand - deliberately dropping the ball favouring pushups over running in the sand dunes. Joelo (hands-like-a-digital-watch) was at the centre of the stalling tactics. The rest of the group were thankful.

On arrival at the dunes there was a warm up effort. Between the dogs with locator beacon lights and the increasing light levels there was a background sound of groaning and heavy breathing that wouldn't be out of place in a Trump | Stormy trail without the *results*. The time away from the dunes was becoming evident - a rough morning lay ahead. 

The remainder of the session on the dunes had relays, burpees, some odd side plank thing that crushed everyone and backwards running... 

In a 'Bolt-like' effort the Big 'O' claimed victory in the most pointless race on earth. They say everyone has a super power of some kind, we all just need to find out what it is...you might have found yours Owie.

In the spirit of being a good 'sport' Farmer decided to give Paddy the chance to play some touch footy with his mates. In a well marked out pitch a jovial game of touch was set up. Turns out some of us were happy enough to let footy be the winner while others were prepared to lie, steal and cheat to claim victory. Given the State of Origin is on this week it is neither appropriate nor required to say who thought sheep stations were on the line but... there were claims of multiple hat-tricks as some middle-aged *average-at-best* footy players were making claims for a spot in Origin sides. Footy was the winner.

The session ended with a snake run back down the beach - with the prevailing team dutifully unloading on the rest of the group with enough trash talk to sink a small ship - before what can only be described as a heavenly swim. 

As is the case, the birthday boy shouted everyone breakfast. Thanks Farmer. When ordering the staff asked if we saw Bay Watch stars getting out of the surf a little earlier. Images have been obtained of the group that brought about the rumours - on close inspection its easy to see why they thought cast members from Bay Watch were in town...
