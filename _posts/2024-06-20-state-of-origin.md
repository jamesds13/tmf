## Warm up Games 

Most recently there was a scratch match to see who would be up to form for the Melbourne game. Needless to say that there was a loser and a winner under the most controversial of circumstances. The controversy can generally be applied to the quality of the supervision (referee - Tex) - as has always been the case. 

To set the scene. Teddy took the group on what could be called little more than a pedestrian stroll around the beaches just on sunrise. It was a perfect warm-up. There were kids with ADD, old men comparing notes on swollen prostates, complaints about flu like symptoms. Spirits were high. As the sun started to rise above the ocean horizon the field was marked out. 

The Northern try line was a tractor tyre track in the sand. The officials then officially paced out with (regulation steps) and promptly marked out the Southern try line. The wall marked the Western sideline and the ocean the Eastern sideline. This is where the controversy began. There were calls for a longer pitch, a better marked out try line, wait until the lighting was better, the sand was cold. The complaints went on and on... the official was claimed to have muttered FFS, why me. This was even before the teams were picked. 

On picking the teams, its always tough this time of the year. One of the blokes supports a team that everyone hates (almost everyone but the Kiwi doesn't count on these matters). As such the general method for team selection is "us over here against youse over there". It's the fairest method known to man and avoids the passive aggressive selection thing that the kid that gets picked last always feels. I'm either not well liked or bad at the game or both, either way no one wants me on their team.  

The start of the game was marked with a bomb that came down with snow on it. Needless to say it was dropped and fumbled around before the slowest game of touch got underway. Everyone forgot to tell the team running North that they had started as they were still looking at the swell for the morning. The first few plays were lack luster at best. The crowd exercising on the beach were sure wondering if there was any real point to the game (they were right). Then there was a spark...Flamingo gathered the ball from a nothing pass and simply ran around everyone to score at the Southern end. There were calls of touched, and WTF farmer. The video ref was asked about ultimately the score would stand at 1-0. 

After some confusion about the rule around who kicks to who (the official still asking why me) the game was back under way. The next play was inspired. In classic over-the-top, all-or-nothing Softee style he made his way through the centre of the pack to score on the tractor tyre try line. Now, how is it possible the try line could be in question noting it was a 3 foot deep track on a beach that makes a bowling green look rough - more controversy ensued. 

There are moments in all of our lives that we take a moment to appreciate, the birth of a child, marrying the love of your life, winning lotto, an ice cold beer at teh beach on a summers day - you get the idea. Well, on the next kick off the big 'O' must hae thought all of his christmases had come at once on the same day his kid was born. Earlier I mentioned a bomb that came down with snow on it, this one was **bigger**!. the crowd on the beach could have thought they were at a NASA launch site after Faz unloaded on it. As the crowd looked skyward squinting it was thought that it simply vanished or he kicked it so hard the ball exploded ending the game once and for all. This wasn't the case. The ball was seen re-entering orbit far to late by a bleary eyed farmer. Not only was his life at risk from the falling peice of space junk but the luckiest guy on earth, the Big 'O' was bearing down on him at a rate of knots (read brisk walk). After some fumbling around like a young lad late at night on his first date Big 'O' prevailed for the kicking team and scored a try that can only be described as a thing of beauty - a *forwards* try from a kick-off. It was now 2-1. 

The rest of the game was largely irrelevant. As players legs grew ever more tired there were claims of the warm up being too long, hamstrings getting pulled, something about a calf, the kid no-one likes throwing the ball away - general beach touch shenanigans. I think the final score was a draw but as has been known to be the case one side claimed victory and took the ensuing *winners* photos claiming team of the century, GOAT, you name it they claimed it. There were calls for olympic medals at some point.

In all its fair to say that touch footy was the winner. A special mention in despatches should go to Teddy for letting Softee order a tasty take-away banana bread for each of us with the our coffee...
