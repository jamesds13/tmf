## O'lympic Dreams through 6 events 

In an olympic year with the teams starting to make their way to the European continent there were some athletes still vying for glory on the beaches - some dreams would be realised and others would be crushed... 

In the darkness the officials lined everyone up and confirmed the countries in attendance - Fiji, Australia, Canada, Cambodia, USA, Azerbaijan, Colombia, New Zealand and the slavic region were all in attendance with solid representation. The games would run for the next hour or so and for some it would be a religious experience - like the ancient games.

>*The ancient Olympic games, beginning in 776 BCE and ending sometime around 393, could almost be classified as a religious ceremony. The genesis of the Olympics can be traced back to Mount Olympian and the gods - principllay Zeus*

While the athletes had little in common with Zeus - or any god for that matter. It was more like a late night kebab line of misfits with one too many beers after midnight in a variety ot different uniforms. 

The games took the format of six events. Much like the idea that the pentathlete was the complete athlete of the modern era, they truly resembled the gods on which the olympics were based. Nothing like the 'O'lympics; however, the 'Dreams' of *games* did have a mix of strength, speed, endurance and skill. The first event was one of strength - chin ups!!. It was the age old format of a pyramid starting at 1 and going up until you can no longer complete the reps. A combination of overhand and underhand efforts were in play. Cambodia won this event - making it to 9, one more than the tied effort for second of Canada and Azerbaijan. 

The second event was across the road to the oval - a quick crocodile race. You don't need to win you just can't lose. The length fo the oval back to back and the last one to cross the line each time is out. Australia and Cambodia featured in the top few for this event with Canada and the Eastern Bloc both offering gallant efforts. 

Push ups to a cadence was the next event. Unexpectedly the USA claimed this with Columbia and Fiji both offering a strong showing to the cadence. The next event was 'discus' with a 2.5kg plate. It was obvious who had spent time as a little athlete. There was a requirement to spin - such a horse-shite rule. Canada prevailed in the rigged weight throwing efforts with Fiji featuring. Oddly New Zealand has managed to stay out of the points for all of the events to this point in time. Luckily New Zealand, along with all the other countries was clearly was focussed on the joy of effort from the philosophy of olympism.

>*“Olympism is a philosophy of life, exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will and mind. Blending sport with culture and education, Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy of effort, the educational value of good example, social responsibility and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.”*

The group 'Dreams' then set off towards the Queensie grass patch where there would be a plank competition. Simple event this one - hold a plank as long as you can. This event was custom built for the Eastern Bloc nations as they grow up planking - the experience showed. It wasn't without controversy though. The quality of the plank from Columbia needs to be assessed.

Clearly the officials will be looking closely at this for some time but god knows why - the plank from Columbia looks more like the harbour bridge challenge.

In addition to the video footage there was some audio recorded where Cambodia was heard telling Latvia *you can have this one - I'm bored*. This is clearly at odds with the Olympic spirit and will be raised to the officials at a later stage. 

The blue ribbon event for the game was back down in the same arena as the opening ceremony, North Steyne. The field was marked out and the short lengths of garden hose were put in place... this had been talked about for months leading up to the event. 

The results are best captured in the image below - Canada clearly showing Columbia how it's done.

With the coffees ordered and the spanakopita on the table the medal ceremony began and to say there were some questions over the results would be an understatement. WADA was accused of being asleep at the wheel, Cambodia/ Fiji was thought to be talking with China as he continued to shop for countries in teh region and New Zealand was heard to complain that the 'O'lympic Dreams were more of a nightmare than a dream. 

Like all great events though, they will return regardless of the question marks that surround the results.
