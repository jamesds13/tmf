## O'lympic Dreams through 6 events 

In an olympic year with the teams starting to make their way to the European continent there were some athletes still vying for glory on the beaches - some dreams would be realised and others would be crushed... 

In the darkness the officials lined everyone up and confirmed the countries in attendance - Fiji, Australia, Canada, Cambodia, USA, Azerbaijan, Colombia, New Zealand and the slavic region were all in attendance with solid representation. The games would run for the next hour or so and for some it would be a religious experience - like the ancient games.

>*The ancient Olympic games, beginning in 776 BCE and ending sometime around 393, could almost be classified as a religious ceremony. The genesis of the Olympics can be traced back to Mount Olympian and the gods - principllay Zeus*

While the athletes had little in common with Zeus - or any god for that matter. It was more like a late night kebab line of misfits with one too many beers after midnight in a variety ot different uniforms. 

The games took the format of six events. Much like the idea that the pentathlete was the complete athlete of the modern era, they truly resembled the gods on which the olympics were based. Nothing like the 'O'lympics; however, the 'Dreams' of a *games* did have a mix of strength, speed, endurance and skill. The first event was one of strength - chin ups!!. It was the age old format of a pyramid starting at 1 and going up until you can no longer complete the reps. A combination of overhand and underhand efforts were in play. Cambodia won this event - making it to 9, one more than the tied effort for second. 

The second event was across the road to the oval for the next event - a quick crocodile race. You don't need to win you just can't lose. The length fo the oval back to back and the last one to cross the line each time is out. Australia and Cambodia featured in the top few for this event with Canada and the Eastern Bloc both offering gallant efforts. 

Push ups by cadence was the next event. Unexpectedly the USA claimed this with Columbia nd Fiji both offering a strong showing to the cadence. The next event was 'discus' with a 2.5kg plate. It was obvious who had spent time as a little athlete. There was a requirement to spin - such a horse-shite rule. Canada prevailed in the rigged weight throwing efforts with Fiji featuring. Oddly New Zealand has managed to stay out of the points for all of the events to this point in time. Luckily New Zealand, along with all the other countries clearly. The philosophy is below for a reference - from page 10 of the olympic charter. 

*“Olympism is a philosophy of life, exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will and mind. Blending sport with culture and education, Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy of effort, the educational value of good example, social responsibility and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.”*
