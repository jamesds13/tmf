## D-Train delivers a Circuit for the Sick

Picture perfect conditions and a crutch are two things that underpin the school yard circuit. In darkness the group gathered near North Steyne and waited for direction from the *train*. In a casual manner everyone was told to move over the the boot of one of the cars. "Right then, gather around and grab a weight. Don't be shy, there a little something for everyone. Kettle bells, plates, come on grab one. OK then, get that stuff down to the surf club and back to the park down there. Get going" And like that the group was off. No messing around here as the sun started to rise. 

With a quick trip down to the surf club complete and everyone back at the playground the Train threw his crutch away and attempted to keep the attention of the kelpie with ADD - no easy task. A short circuit know as **TMF-45** was then explained. A total body system of push-ups, russian twists, TRX rows, step-ups, halo's with a squat, shoulder presses, dips - the list goes on. The exercise of choice was the shoulder press. There were early calls of counting the number of reps out loud and this was the competition for the morning. Faz led the group early with a 33. Not to be out done, Joelo defied the odds with a high thirty effort - not bad for arms like pipe cleaners. The group cycled through and the numbers grew ever greater. Junior rolled through called for 40 something, Tex was again bettering the level with a high 40's before Nicko eclipsed the group with a 50 something. The next thing we knew it was like Ron Burgundy had showed up. Someone was heard to say 63,64,65 as the time was up. Then there was a 72,73 - you get it. No one in the group really knows what was the biggest number was but it didn't really matter. Everyone was having a go.

Owie was heard muttering under his breath why there was push ups after the dips. This may have been an issue with the ordering of the exercises but it doesn't matter - this is **TMF-45**. Big Bird was quick on the technique correction which we all could do with but some more than others. The quick run down to the surf club and back between the rounds of 10 meant that the session was full and everyone was smoked at the end. The three rounds finished up right on time. D-Train then gathered up his crutch and hobbled back to the obligatory coffee and catch up. The weather was perfect and the company excellent, it only got better when McGrath dropped in. There were subsequent calls for his admission to the group - one out and one in. There were two founding fathers at the table and no obvious objections. In fact everyone thought he may be an upgrade on a few of the fellas that were missing from the session. No doubt there will be more conversations on this short but influential *drop in*.
