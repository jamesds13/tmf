## Softee's Complete Picture 

When commentating for the olympic finals there is a classic line that many of the callers have used - *They've come out running...*. This did not apply to Softee's session. There were a few push-ups, a light jog and allegations of thinking about yourself (god knows what that means).

At the start of the session D-Train and Junior were quickly cast aside and sent to the infirmary for the morning due some some kind of *hartlage* issue. Farmer was hobbling around looking like a lost dog for a spell, until he found his dog and they both walked around the beach checking (pissing) on things. This is next level innovation! The infirmed managed to cobble together a session that involved a few weights, a TRX and a metric shedload of push-ups and squats. Being careful not to put any more stress on already broken physical forms they managed to muster up a few beads of sweat on a chilly morning - not a complete waste of time.

As part of Farmers patrols he isn't sure the same can be said for the main group. The light jog down to the surf club involved plenty of soul searching before there was some rock hopping looking for lobsters in the dark. Realising you couldn't see anything this was quickly abandoned and everyone moved to the beach for a quiet sit-down. Someone was heard asking if this is a new planking technique that Softee has been working on (see image below). At this point a wonderful lady approached the group and praised them for being mindful. Little did she know that the idea was to exercise (its in the name...). Sotfee being who he is took the complement and figured he was continuing to break new ground for the group.

After a short stroll back up the beach as a group with the sun rising they called it off - another great success story. The infirmed pair and the dog walker all gathered their things up and made their way to the coffee shop for the obligatory catch up. When asked who was paying Faz said he had it. Confused glances shot around the group. One of the FF was rumoured to have asked what was going on w TMF. 

>*He runs that kind of session then doesn't even shout the coffees. This requires some attention. It's almost unacceptable.*

To be fair, the treasurer wasn't surprised when he was passed the details quipping that it's good to get a nothing session every so often but he to couldn't get passed the coffee payment issue and is still at a loss what this will do for his stats for the year. Softee may have created a whole new category. Innovative if nothing else.
